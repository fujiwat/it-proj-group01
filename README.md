## Overview
This is a group work at the university.
We, 5 members created a Web Calculator as "Worth of Reference" Calculator.

## Summary
Five Ingenuity Points
- Button layout and Coloring
- Notification by Sound
- Key and Screen, dual input
- Support Web Accessibility
- Web Font for Multi-Devices
Got perfect rating from 2 objective tests.

## Usage
Just Click the buttons as same as the physical regular calculator. If you want to get the result of 1 + 2 * 3 then that means 1 + (2 * 3) = 7 therefore you need to click following order:
[2] [*] [3] [+] [1] [=]
When you click the buttons for * / - + then the calculation is immediately occurred. Therefore, if you click buttons by the following order then the result is ( 1 + 2 ) * 3 = 9:
[1] [+] [2] [*] [3] [=]

## Features
### Point 1.  Button Layout and Coloring
Darker color placed outside.  Easy to find number buttons at center area.
You can use touch typing easily.

### Point 2. Notification by Sound
5 types of Sound:  0-9.   +-รทร   AC   C    BS
Found a suitable sound from a license-free website and made it shorter (https://soundeffect-lab.info/sound/button/)

### Point 3. Dual Input Methods, From Keyboard and Click/Tap
It is better to have key input for realistic calculator program.
We can input faster using hardware keyboard.

### Point 4. Web Accessibility for Visual Disabilities
- Contrast between Text and Background needs 3:1
Several Color sets are tested.

- Consideration for People With Color Blindness
Every buttons, text is able to recognize clearly

## Restrictions
The calculation values are using double which means 64bit IEEE floating-point number type. Sometimes it causes a margin of error therefore this program round to the 10th decimal place.

## Reference
This program is derived from the following source code and modified the color and added functions "1/x", "Sin", "Cos", "Tan", and decimal point.
